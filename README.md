# Lua Obfuscator
 Obfuscate your lua code because it's so easy to steal!

# How to use

First, download it via the releases tab

Second, make sure to extract the files (won't work if you just open it in the zip)

Third, run the exe and type the path to the lua files you'd like to be obfuscated (e.g C:\Users\user\Desktop\obf-these-files will obfuscate all the lua files in that directory)

# How to compile
First, open the Lua Obfuscator.sln

Second, make your changes

Third, with Visual Studio, at the top press Build then Build Solution (this can change depending on your IDE)

# I have an error
If you have an issue please open one on GitHub and I'll try to help.
